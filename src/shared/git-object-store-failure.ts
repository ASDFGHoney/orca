/**
 * Classify "Git cannot read an object it needs" failures and turn them into a
 * message a user can act on.
 *
 * Why this exists: `git worktree add` resolves the branch tip from the ref
 * database but reads the *tree* from the object database, so a repo whose commit
 * object survives while its tree does not passes every commit-only preflight and
 * then dies inside the checkout. Orca cannot prevent that (the damage is
 * environment-side: filtered clone, interrupted fetch, gc/repack race, disk
 * corruption), so the failure path has to name it and say how to repair it.
 *
 * Lives in shared/ because the classifier must run on the client: the raw text
 * can also arrive from an older relay host that never wrapped it.
