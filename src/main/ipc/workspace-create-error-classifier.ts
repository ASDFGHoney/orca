// Why: the throw sites are bare `throw new Error('...')` calls in
// worktree-remote.ts, some of which interpolate user-controlled content
// (branch names, paths). The classifier reads `error.message` to bucket, but
// the matched strings never cross the wire — only the enum value does. The
// schema discipline at telemetry-events.ts §"Properties to keep off these
// events" is what makes that safe.
//
// Substring set is intentionally narrow: per the schema-evolution doctrine,
// widening this match set later requires explicit review, not silent regex
// expansion. Anything we cannot confidently bucket falls through to `unknown`.

// `cause`), and that raw text is the only place `Permission denied`/`EACCES` survives. Reading
// it back is a widening of the INPUT, not of the match set below, and the matched strings still
// never leave this process — only the enum does.
